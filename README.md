## Description

_This is an independent project for Epicodus to practice my skills learned during my first week studying Ruby.<br>An anagram is defined as a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another. This program can compare two words or phrases to determine whether or not they are anagrams. It can also determine whether two words or phrases contain NO matching characters._
